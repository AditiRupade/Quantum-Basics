## Quantum Basics

This repository contains some basic implementations of quantum circuits and introduction to commonly used quantum gates. There is also a section on quantum visualizations to visualize quantum states and measurements. 

I have developed the quantum circuits using IBM's library 'QISKIT'

This guide will help in Getting Started on using Qiskit -
https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html

### Local Development

Qiskit supports Python 3.6 or later. According to Qiskit team, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is recommended for using Qiskit as it also provides Jupyter notebook.

To install qiskit, use the following command:

  $ pip install qiskit
  
For visualization functionality, use the following command:

  $ pip install qiskit[visualization]
  
For Mac users:

  $ pip install 'qiskit[visualization]'
  
### IBM Cloud

IBM also provides a great cloud with qiskit tutorial - https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/
